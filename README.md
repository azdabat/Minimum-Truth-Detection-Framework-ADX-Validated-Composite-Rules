## Operational Calibration & Testing

> [!NOTE]
> These detection rules are architected for **logical correctness** and **high-fidelity signal extraction**. Validation was performed in an isolated **ADX-Docker** environment to ensure attack-truth and logic integrity using Empire threat telemetry & Atomic Red Team.
>
> - **Baselines:** Final noise tuning and allow-listing require specific tenant telemetry and administrative context.
> - **Syntax:** Minor syntax variances (e.g., path escaping) may exist due to the difference between Docker-hosted Kusto and live Cloud schemas.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Operational Readiness & Integrity**
>
> - **Not "Plug-and-Play":** This is not a copy-paste production repository. Every rule here is considered **untested** unless accompanied by "receipts" — specifically ADX-Docker Empire telemetry results and dedicated documentation.
> - **Engineering vs. Scripting:** This is a record of engineering work, not a basic KQL collection. It represents the iterative process of testing, tuning, and refining logic from scratch.
> - **The Evolution:** While legacy POC repositories contain the "brittle monoliths" of early-career detection, this composite section represents the philosophy of true detection engineering.
> - **Originality:** Nothing in this repository is copied; nothing has been borrowed. This documentation is designed to teach a way of thinking.
> - **The Goal:** As anyone who has been in the trenches knows: engineering freedom is only found when architecture becomes simple, reductive, and easy to understand.
>
> **This is Detection-As-Code in its purest form.** *(Fully automated CI/CD pipeline section currently under development)*

## Engineering Notes

During validation of the Minimum Truth Detection Framework composite rule set, several recurring implementation pitfalls were identified while stress-testing multiple KQL detections.

These issues do **not affect the detection doctrine itself** (*Minimum Truth → Reinforcement → Scoring → Hunter Directive*), but arise from common **KQL engineering edge cases** including:

- Prevalence window overlap
- Incorrect `leftouter` join handling
- SHA256 rarity edge cases
- Non-deterministic `any()` summarization
- Negative composite score behaviour

**[KQL Detection Engineering — Common Implementation Errors](https://github.com/azdabat/Minimum-Truth-Detection-Framework-ADX-Validated-Composite-Rules/blob/main/KQL%20Detection%20Engineering%20%E2%80%94%20Common%20Implementation%20Errors.md)**

This document acts as an engineering reference and lint guide for KQL detection development, capturing the bug classes discovered during composite rule validation. Its purpose is to ensure the framework remains **deterministic, reliable, and production-safe** as additional detection logic is developed.

---

## Detection Engineering Lifecycle

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This framework is complemented by a dedicated **Detection Engineering Lifecycle model**, which defines how composite detections are **validated, tuned, scored, and governed in real SOC environments**.
>
> While the core doctrine establishes *how detections should be architected*, this lifecycle formalises **how they survive production reality** — including telemetry constraints, noise modelling, performance trade-offs, and continuous refinement.
>
> It captures the transition from **theoretical correctness → operational reliability**, ensuring every rule is not only logically sound, but **measurably effective and SOC-safe over time**.

## ATT&CK Substrate Adjacency

**[ATT&CK Substrate Adjacency — Full Document](https://github.com/azdabat/Minimum-Truth-Detection-Framework-ADX-Validated-Composite-Rules/blob/main/ATT%26CK_Substrate_Adjacency.md)**

MITRE ATT&CK models techniques as independent units with vertical depth (technique → sub-technique). What it does not model is **substrate adjacency** — the reality that many techniques represent the same adversary intent executed across different operating system substrates.

Lateral movement via **SMB (T1021.002)**, **DCOM (T1021.003)**, and **WinRM (T1021.006)** are operationally interchangeable. An adversary pivots dynamically between them based on firewall restrictions, privileges, and endpoint controls. Treating these as independent creates a **false sense of detection coverage**.

The Minimum Truth Detection Framework introduces a **Cousin Technique Doctrine** — modelling adjacent techniques as part of a shared attack ecosystem. This layer sits on top of ATT&CK and enables detection strategies that target **adversary intent** rather than isolated technique identifiers.

---

## Attack Ecosystem Intelligence — Defeating Temporal Deception

Modern adversary tradecraft relies heavily on **Temporal Deception** — staggered C2 jitter, delayed BYOVD kernel exploitation, and automated script loops that pivot dynamically across parallel execution boundaries (Cousin Techniques).

When defensive units rely on monolithic, join-dependent kill chains, they face catastrophic query timeouts or miss intrusions entirely due to sequence fracturing over time.

This framework formalises a **hybrid architecture**: deploying optimised, single-surface Behavioural Composites to deliver immediate high-confidence alerts (*Hunter Directives*), while concurrently running a silent Incident-Layer Stitching Engine mapped to common entity keys (`DeviceName`, `AccountName`).

By separating the sensor architecture from chronological storytelling, this framework achieves true scale-safe efficiency — forcing immediate narrative convergence the exact second an attacker touches an un-bypassable telemetric substrate choke point.

## Why This Repository Exists

Most SOCs struggle with threat hunting not because they lack tools, but because:

- Detections are **over-engineered** — monolithic queries that collapse under production load
- Behavioural chains are **forced where they are not required** — ghost chains producing false certainty
- Analysts are overwhelmed by **noise disguised as intelligence**
- Rules are written without regard for **SOC operating reality**

This repository documents a **deliberate, operationally grounded methodology** for threat hunting that:

- Scales to real SOC teams under real enterprise load
- Preserves signal fidelity without brittle allowlists
- Reduces analyst fatigue through contextual scoring
- Applies behavioural correlation **only when the attack structurally requires it**

**Focus:** Practical, adversary-informed threat hunting for real SOC environments  
**Audience:** L2 / L2.5 Threat Hunters, Detection Engineers, Security Leads

---

## Detection Maturity Model

### Reductive Baseline — Truth First

Every attack technique has a **minimum condition that must be true**. If that condition is not met, the detection should not exist. This prevents speculative or assumption-driven hunting.

### Composite L2 / L2.5 Hunts

Most attacks do **not** require full behavioural chains. This repository focuses on Composite Hunts that group related high-signal indicators, prefer single telemetry sources, and use minimal joins only when unavoidable. This is where **most effective threat hunting lives**.

### Reinforcement — Confidence, Not Dependency

Once baseline truth is met, confidence is increased using parent/child execution context, suspicious paths, network proximity, and rarity/prevalence. Reinforcement improves fidelity. Reinforcement reduces noise. **Reinforcement never defines the attack.**

### Behavioural Chains — Used Sparingly

Correlation is used **only when the attack cannot exist without multiple linked events**. DLL sideloading is the canonical example — neither the DLL drop nor the binary load alone proves the technique. Only together, correlated within a time window, do they constitute truth.

```mermaid

## Core Doctrine — The Minimum Truth Funnel

### The Problem at Enterprise Scale

In environments of 100,000+ endpoints, traditional detection fails at the database layer. Standard SIEM rules rely on monolithic queries — massive, multi-table `join` operations executed across raw telemetry — producing query timeouts, extreme compute costs, and what this framework defines as **Bleak Outcomes**: high-confidence intrusions missed entirely because the query never completed.

```
Traditional monolithic rule:
  Stage A  AND  Stage B within 15 minutes  AND  Stage C on same host
  → 100k endpoints → DeviceProcessEvents 500M+ rows/day
  → Cross-table join on raw data → TIMEOUT
  → Attacker delays Stage B by 72 hours → TIME WINDOW MISSED
  → Attacker pivots from SMB to WMI → JOIN CONDITION BROKEN
  → Detection: NULL
```

### The Three Pillars

**Filter Before You Join.** Never join two raw tables. Reduce the primary table to its most critical subset — the truth — before asking for context. A query filtering `DeviceRegistryEvents` to three specific key paths before a pre-summarised prevalence join runs in seconds on a 100k estate. The same query joining raw `DeviceProcessEvents` times out.

**Native Enrichment Over Joins.** Modern EDR schemas carry implicit context. `DeviceRegistryEvents` already contains `InitiatingProcessFileName`, `InitiatingProcessSHA256`, `InitiatingProcessSigner`, and `InitiatingProcessVersionInfoCompanyName`. Mapping these native fields eliminates the `DeviceProcessEvents` join entirely — zero memory pressure, full process context.

**Contextual Scoring, Not Binary Alerts.** Once truth is established, route surviving data through a convergence matrix. A cumulative risk score prevents dangerous truths from being suppressed when a safe signal is present, and prevents noise from being elevated when a dangerous signal is absent.

```
BaseScore (Truth Anchor)      =  55
+ TaskCache Artefact          = +25
+ Dangerous Primitive         = +25
+ Base64 Payload              = +20
+ User-Writable Path          = +15
+ Untrusted Writer            = +10
+ Rare Writer (Prevalence)    = +10
──────────────────────────────────────
FinalScore                    = 160  →  CRITICAL
```

## Substrate-First vs Intent-First Minimum Truth

### The Architectural Decision

Every detection begins with a choice: anchor on the **execution substrate itself**, or anchor on a **malicious primitive** performed by that substrate. Choosing the wrong strategy is a primary cause of detection failure at scale.

### Substrate-First — The Canonical Case: WMI Fileless Execution

In a WMI Permanent Event Subscription attack, an adversary registers a malicious `ActiveScriptEventConsumer`. When triggered, Windows Script Host (`scrcons.exe`) loads a script engine DLL — `vbscript.dll`, `jscript.dll`, or `scrobj.dll` — directly into process memory.

**There is no child process. No command-line argument. No file written to disk.**

The payload executes as a DLL loaded into a trusted Windows process. Attempting to anchor on intent fails here — there is no attacker-controlled command-line visible at the DLL load layer. The substrate IS the signal.

```kql
// Minimum Truth — WMI Fileless Execution (T1546.003)
DeviceImageLoadEvents
| where InitiatingProcessFileName =~ "scrcons.exe"
| where FileName in~ ("vbscript.dll", "jscript.dll", "scrobj.dll")
// This is the irreducible minimum. You cannot go further left in the kill chain.
```

Reinforcement adds confidence after truth is confirmed:

```kql
// R1: Near-time network egress from scrcons.exe → C2 beacon signal
DeviceNetworkEvents
| where InitiatingProcessFileName =~ "scrcons.exe"
| where RemoteIPType == "Public" and RemotePort in (80, 443)

// R2: DLL loaded from non-system path → staging artefact
// R3: First-time behaviour on this device in 30 days → prevalence anomaly
```

> **Substrate first. Reinforcement second. Always.**

### Substrate-First — BYOVD Driver Staging (Temporal Case)

BYOVD attacks exploit time. A vulnerable `.sys` driver is dropped quietly on Day 0. A service is created days later. The driver drop is the only observable primitive at the time it occurs — no execution, no intent visible.

```kql
// Minimum Truth — BYOVD Driver Staging (T1543.003 / T1068)
DeviceFileEvents
| where FileName endswith ".sys"
| where FolderPath matches regex @"(?i)\\(AppData|Temp|Public|ProgramData|Users)\\"
| where InitiatingProcessSignatureStatus != "Signed"
   or InitiatingProcessFolderPath matches regex @"(?i)\\(AppData|Temp|Public)\\"
// A .sys file dropped to a writable path by an anomalously located binary
// is the substrate truth. The driver is passive. The substrate IS the signal.
```

The 30-day atomic primitive index connects the Day 0 staging to the Day 3 activation — defeating temporal deception that no time-windowed composite rule can address alone.

### Intent-First — The Primitive Implies Capability

When the execution substrate is ubiquitous, the only reliable anchor is a specific action on that substrate that structurally implies attacker capability. The primitive is the anchor, not the binary.

```kql
// Minimum Truth — PowerShell Intent (T1059.001)
DeviceProcessEvents
| where FileName in~ ("powershell.exe", "pwsh.exe")
| where ProcessCommandLine has_any (
    "Invoke-WebRequest", "DownloadString",   // Remote retrieval
    "FromBase64String", "IEX",              // Payload decoding + in-memory exec
    "Add-Type", "-EncodedCommand",          // .NET loading + obfuscated exec
    "VirtualAlloc", "OpenProcess"           // Memory allocation / injection primitives
)
```

PowerShell running is common. PowerShell performing remote retrieval, payload decoding, or memory allocation is not common in legitimate enterprise workflows. The primitive raises base confidence before any reinforcement is applied.

## OAuth Consent Abuse — Applying Both Anchoring Strategies

Unlike endpoint execution, OAuth abuse is identity-driven and user-mediated. The distinction between substrate-first and intent-first becomes operationally critical here.

### OAuth Substrate-First

A successful consent grant occurred. A trust boundary changed. This does not imply malicious intent — it is substrate truth appropriate for tenant visibility and baseline modelling.

```kql
AuditLogs
| where OperationName in~ (
    "Consent to application",
    "Add delegated permission grant",
    "Add app role assignment grant to service principal"
)
| where Result =~ "success"
```

### OAuth Intent-First

Intent-first in OAuth is not "consent happened." It is: **high-risk permission capability was granted.**

```kql
AuditLogs
| where OperationName in~ (
    "Consent to application",
    "Add delegated permission grant",
    "Add app role assignment grant to service principal"
)
| where Result =~ "success"
| mv-expand TargetResources[0].modifiedProperties
| where tostring(TargetResources[0].modifiedProperties.newValue) has_any (
    "Mail.ReadWrite",
    "Directory.ReadWrite.All",
    "AppRoleAssignment.ReadWrite.All",
    "RoleManagement.ReadWrite.Directory",
    "Files.ReadWrite.All",
    "Sites.FullControl.All"
)
```

The scope grant is the primitive that implies capability — it is the intent anchor that makes the detection stable. Without it, the rule requires endless tuning against thousands of legitimate application consent events.

### OAuth Composite Integration

```
Sensor Layer  (Substrate-First) →  Visibility · baseline modelling · consent velocity
Intent Layer  (Intent-First)    →  High-risk scope capability granted
Reinforcement                   →  Admin consent (OnBehalfOfAll == true)
                                    Suspicious User-Agent · FirstSeen AppId
                                    Rare AppId in tenant · Privileged user
Scoring                         →  Substrate consent = low base score
                                    High-risk permission = primary weight

## Noise Model & Suppression Strategy

### Core Principle

Noise is not removed through blind exclusions. It is **measured, profiled, and down-scored** through contextual weighting.

```kql
// ❌ Hard exclusion — creates structural blind spots
| where InitiatingProcessFileName != "ccmexec.exe"

// ✅ Soft-allow scoring model
let Penalty_ManagedLineage = -25;
let Penalty_InternalNet    = -10;
let Penalty_HighBurst      = -20;
```

Management automation reduces risk. It does not eliminate telemetry visibility.

### Empirical Noise Baseline — Pre-Tuning Requirement

Before suppression logic is applied, extract dominant operational patterns:

```kql
DeviceProcessEvents
| where FileName =~ "powershell.exe"
| summarize
    Count   = count(),
    Devices = dcount(DeviceId)
  by InitiatingProcessFileName,
     InitiatingProcessAccountName,
     bin(Timestamp, 1h)
| order by Count desc
```

> **Noise suppression begins with measurement — not assumptions.**

### Scoring Model for Suppression

```kql
let Score_EncodedPrimitive = 40;
let Score_SuspiciousParent = 30;
let Score_WritablePath     = 20;
let Score_ExternalNetwork  = 25;
let Score_RareExecution    = 15;

let Penalty_ManagedLineage = -25;  // SCCM, Intune, Tanium lineage
let Penalty_InternalNet    = -10;  // Internal IP egress only
let Penalty_HighBurst      = -20;  // 50+ hosts in 10 minutes
```

Tenant-portable suppression uses configuration tables rather than hardcoded values:

```kql
let TrustedAutomationParents =
datatable(ProcessName:string)
[
    "ccmexec.exe",
    "intunemanagementextension.exe",
    "taniumclient.exe"
];
```

### Burst Modelling

```kql
DeviceProcessEvents
| where FileName =~ "powershell.exe"
| summarize BurstCount = dcount(DeviceId)
  by bin(Timestamp, 10m)
| order by BurstCount desc
// High volume simultaneous → patch deployment → down-score
// Low volume isolated → targeted intrusion → escalate
```

### Architectural Summary

| Principle | Implementation |
|-----------|----------------|
| No brittle allowlists | Score reduction instead of exclusion |
| Measure before suppressing | Empirical baseline extraction first |
| Convergence required | Multiple reinforcement layers needed for escalation |
| Prevalence modifies urgency | Never suppresses alerts |
| Burst modelling | Differentiates mass automation from targeted intrusion |
| Config-driven tuning | Avoids hard-coded exclusions across tenants |

> **Detection engineering is not about eliminating noise.**  
> **It is about anchoring truth, reinforcing intent, modelling behaviour, scoring convergence, and preserving visibility.**  
> **Noise suppression must never create blind spots.**

---

## Rarity & Organisational Prevalence

> **Rarity is not a detection trigger. It is a prioritisation and confidence amplifier.**  
> **If the minimum truth is not satisfied, rarity is irrelevant.**  
> **If the minimum truth is satisfied, rarity decides urgency and scope.**

### Three Safe Applications

**Command / Behaviour Prevalence**  
How many hosts exhibit this exact behaviour?
- 1–2 hosts → likely targeted intrusion → escalate
- 200+ hosts → likely IT automation → deprioritise (never suppress)

**Actor / Parent Context Prevalence**  
Who normally performs this action in this environment?
- `rundll32.exe` spawned by `winword.exe` → anomalous execution context
- Service account accessing data outside its role → privilege anomaly

**Burst / Radius Prevalence**  
How fast and how widely did this appear?
- Single host → targeted persistence
- Domain-wide in under 10 minutes → ransomware precursor

### What Prevalence Is NOT Used For

| Wrong | Right |
|-------|-------|
| Rarity as standalone alert trigger | Rarity as reinforcement signal after truth |
| Common = safe | Common = lower urgency, not lower visibility |
| Rare = malicious | Rare = higher priority, not automatic alert |
| Suppress LSASS access on AV hosts | Surface always — score urgency by actor context |

> **Rarity decides how fast we respond — not whether we respond.**

**Example — Prevalence Applied After Truth:**

```kql
// Minimum Truth already established — persistence exists:
RegistryValueData has "powershell" and RegistryValueData has "\\users\\public\\"

// Prevalence reinforcement applied AFTER truth confirmation:
| summarize DeviceCount = dcount(DeviceId) by TaskFingerprint
| extend IsRare = DeviceCount <= 2
// 1 device  → likely intrusion     → CRITICAL urgency
// 300 devices → likely IT script  → MEDIUM urgency
// The detection never disappears. The response priority changes.
```

**Minimum Truth defines the attack. Reinforcement increases confidence. Prevalence scales triage.**

---

## Correlation vs Ghost Chains

> **Correlation is only valid when the attack cannot exist without multiple linked events.**

### What Is a Ghost Chain?

A ghost chain stitches together unrelated events into fake kill-chain certainty:

```kql
// ❌ Ghost chain — forces false narrative
RegistryValueSet
| join NetworkConnection on DeviceId
| join ProcessInjection on DeviceId
| where all within 10 minutes
// Persistence may be set today, executed tomorrow → time window MISSED
// Network traffic is unrelated → FALSE POSITIVE
// Injection never occurs → NULL SCORE on real intrusion
```

### The Correct Architecture — Independent Sensors

```kql
// Sensor 1: Persistence truth
DeviceRegistryEvents
| where RegistryKey has "\\Run"
| where RegistryValueData has "powershell"
// Truth: persistence exists. Do not join this. Do not extend this. Alert on this.

// Sensor 2: In-memory execution truth
DeviceEvents
| where ActionType == "PowerShellScriptBlock"
| where AdditionalFields has "VirtualAlloc"
// Truth: in-memory execution capability is being prepared.

// Sensor 3: Silent task persistence truth
DeviceRegistryEvents
| where RegistryKey has "\\Schedule\\TaskCache"
| where RegistryValueData has "-enc"
// Truth: silent scheduled task persistence exists.
```

**Incident-Level Correlation:** The SIEM correlates same device + same user + same timeframe + multiple truths firing. This builds the attack story correctly — without ghost chains inside individual rules.

### Correlation vs Ghost Chains — Decision

```
Correlate inside a rule ONLY when:
  → The technique cannot exist without both events
  → Telemetry sources are stable and reliable
  → The join reduces ambiguity, not increases complexity

Split into sibling composites when:
  → The truth surface changes
  → The noise domain changes
  → The attacker method is optional
  → The timing may vary across sessions or days
```

> **Correlation is not sophistication. Correlation is dependency.**

### Entity Keys — The Stitching Mechanism

| Entity Key | Stitching Context |
|------------|------------------|
| `DeviceName` | Host-level — connects all events to one machine |
| `AccountName` | Identity-level — connects to same actor across hosts |
| `DeviceId` | Hardware-level — tamper-resistant stitching |
| `SHA256` | Artefact-level — connects binary drops across time |
| `RemoteIP / ASN` | Infrastructure-level — C2 attribution across hosts |

### The KQL Primitive Collector

Executed automatically when a composite fires — reconstructing the full entity timeline:

```kql
// ATOMIC PRIMITIVE COLLECTOR
// Triggered by composite anchor — not an alert, a hunting pivot

let EntityKey_Device = "SRV-01";                              // Injected from composite
let AnchorTime       = datetime(2026-05-20T14:22:00Z);        // Composite fire timestamp
let LookbackWindow   = 30d;
let ForwardWindow    = 2h;

let P_Execution =
    DeviceProcessEvents
    | where Timestamp between ((AnchorTime - LookbackWindow) .. (AnchorTime + ForwardWindow))

    | project Timestamp, Layer="Execution",
              Event = strcat(FileName, " | ", InitiatingProcessFileName, " | ", ProcessCommandLine),
              MITRE = "T1059/T1218";

let P_Persistence =

## Architecture Doctrine — At Scale

### Why This Matters

In enterprise-scale environments (100k+ endpoints), traditional Detection Engineering fails at the database layer. The Minimum Truth framework flips the paradigm: instead of asking the database to correlate everything at once, it forces the query to establish the absolute minimum baseline of malicious truth *first*, discard the rest of the noise, and only then enrich the surviving data.

### Phase 1 — Establish Minimum Truth (The Funnel)

Immediately restrict the dataset to specific high-value keys. Define Danger and Safe parameters dynamically — never hardcoded.

### Phase 2 — Zero-Join Native Enrichment

Extract `InitiatingProcess*` fields natively present in the optimised EDR schema. This eliminates the heavyweight `DeviceProcessEvents` join entirely. Zero memory pressure. Full process context.

### Phase 3 — The Safe Join (Prevalence Only)

The only join permitted is a **pre-summarised join**. Summarise `DeviceFileEvents` to a tiny `OrgPrevalence` table first, then `leftouter` join it to the already-filtered registry events. **Small table joined to small table.**

### Phase 4 — Convergence Scoring

Score the remnant data against a contextual matrix and output with a SOC-ready Hunter Directive. Not a binary alert. A contextual story.

## Hunter Directives

Every composite hunt produces **guidance alongside results — not after**.

Each rule outputs a `HunterDirective` that answers:

1. **Why** this fired — baseline truth confirmed
2. **What** reinforces confidence — scoring context
3. **What** to do next — pivot, scope blast radius, escalate

> *HIGH: LSASS accessed by non-AV process using dump-related command line.*
> *Action: Validate tool legitimacy, scope for lateral movement, escalate to L3.*

Hunter Directives are SOC-ready playbooks embedded in the detection output. Rules are not just detections — they are operational response guides.

---

## The Rule Factory Checklist

Before publishing any composite hunt:

| Requirement | Check |
|-------------|-------|
| Minimum Truth is 1 clear anchor | ✅ |
| Reinforcement signals are optional (2–4 max) | ✅ |
| Convergence window is defined | ✅ |
| Noise suppression is explicit | ✅ |
| Org prevalence is scoring only — never a hard filter | ✅ |
| Severity is cumulative, not binary | ✅ |
| Output is SOC-actionable with Hunter Directive | ✅ |

> **The Golden Rule: If you cannot explain the hunt in 60 seconds, it is too complex.**  
> **Composite engineering is clarity, not bloat.**

---

## Architectural Strategy — Split vs Composite

> We do not group rules by MITRE Tactic.  
> We group rules by **Attack Surface Ecosystem** — the operational domain where the same kind of truth is observable.

> **The detection rule is the sensor. The incident/case is the narrative.**

### The Four Rules

**Rule 1 — Split when the Minimum Truth changes.**  
If the baseline event requires a schema change, telemetry change, or mechanism change — SPLIT.

| Shift | Decision |
|-------|----------|
| Host process execution → Identity log transaction | ✂️ SPLIT |
| SMB lateral movement → WMI lateral movement | ✂️ SPLIT |
| Endpoint execution → Identity sign-in truth | ✂️ SPLIT |
| Same LOLBin surface, different intent primitives | ✅ KEEP |

**Critical caveat:** Reinforcement signals may cross telemetry surfaces as long as they remain optional and do not replace the baseline truth.

```
Baseline truth  =  svchost(schedule) spawning suspicious child
Reinforcement   =  TaskCache registry artefacts    ← optional cross-table evidence
Reinforcement   =  Task XML drops                  ← optional cross-table evidence
Reinforcement   =  Org prevalence rarity           ← optional cross-table scoring

Truth anchor remains execution. Registry is supporting evidence, not the trigger.
```

**Rule 2 — Split when the noise domain changes.**  
SCCM automation noise vs developer PowerShell vs DC replication are entirely different noise profiles requiring distinct suppression models. SPLIT.

**Rule 3 — Split when the telemetry surface changes.**  
`DeviceProcessEvents ≠ DeviceRegistryEvents ≠ SigninLogs ≠ DeviceNetworkEvents`

**Rule 4 — Keep composite when refining context.**  
Classification, scoring, enrichment, and reinforcement belong inside the rule when the Minimum Truth stays the same.

### Decision Matrix

| Ecosystem | Scenario | Decision | Reason |
|-----------|----------|----------|--------|
| **Scheduled Tasks** | `schtasks.exe /create` vs `Register-ScheduledTask` | ✂️ SPLIT | Different truth surface: CLI vs API |
| **Scheduled Tasks** | `schtasks.exe /create` vs `schtasks.exe /change` | ✅ KEEP | Same truth domain: same binary + schema |
| **Lateral Movement** | SMB service exec vs WMI remote process | ✂️ SPLIT | Different mechanism, different noise domain |
| **Credential Access** | LSASS dump vs DCSync vs Kerberoasting | ✂️ SPLIT | Different telemetry surfaces entirely |
| **LOLBin Execution** | rundll32 vs regsvr32 vs mshta (same parent, same intent) | ✅ KEEP | Same process surface, same attacker goal |

```
Truth Anchor  = Sensor
Reinforcement = Evidence
Cousins       = Adjacent sensors
Incident      = Story stitching

Truth defines the rule. Reinforcement strengthens it.
```

## Cousin Rules & Attack Ecosystem Coverage

> When a high-fidelity composite is created for one execution surface, its *cousin* is the adjacent surface that shares the same adversary goal but lives in a different **noise domain**.  
> Cousin rules are **separate but paired** — they do not mix truth anchors with noisy signals that dilute fidelity.

### Why Cousin Rules Are Non-Negotiable

Sophisticated threat actors use cousin attack surfaces as **fallback layers**. Automated deployment toolkits contain cousin-surface fallback logic:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A["Attacker executes LockBit deployment script"] --> B
    B["SMB Service Exec\nPort 445 — Segment A\nSMB_Service_Lateral FIRES 🔴"] --> C
    C{"Port 445 blocked\non Segment B"} --> D
    D["Automatic WMI fallback\nPort 135 — Segment B\nWMI_RemoteExec_Cousin FIRES 🔴"] --> E
    E["Shadow copy deletion\nFleet-wide\nShadow_Copy_Composite FIRES 🔴"] --> F
    F["Incident Layer\nAccountName stitching\n'Adversary pivoted SMB → WMI\nScope full subnet NOW'"]
```

A monolithic rule anchored on SMB service creation scores NULL the moment the attacker pivots to WMI. The cousin composite fires independently. The incident layer stitches both surfaces to the same actor. **The pivot is not a defence. It is a data point.**

### Cousin Ecosystem Discovery

This framework is not built on theoretical MITRE grouping — it is built on **empirically discovered cousin ecosystems**, validated through ADX-Docker simulation, Empire-style telemetry, and repeated convergence testing.

### Framework Logic Behind Cousin Pairing

**Different Noise Domain.** `services.exe` service exec — low noise, aggressive rules applicable. `svchost.exe` scheduled task exec — high noise, strict anchors required. Both cover lateral movement. Noise profiles differ fundamentally.

**Separate Truth Anchors.** Service rule anchors on `services.exe` spawning an uncommon child. Scheduled Task cousin anchors on explicit task create/exec signals AND/OR TaskCache registry writes. Logically adjacent — structurally different anchors.

**Composite Isolation.** Coupling them in one rule breaks noise suppression, operational fidelity, and analyst clarity. Separate sensors maintain precision.

**Ecosystem Continuity.** Every primary composite answers four questions:
1. What is the attack surface?
2. What is the minimum truth anchor?
3. What adjacent surfaces share intent?
4. What cousin composites must exist to cover those surfaces?

## Router Rules — Rules That Sit Outside Ecosystems

Not every composite belongs inside a single attack ecosystem. In production, a second class of rules exists:

> **Router Rules — Surface Aggregators**  
> Wide, low-cost detectors that identify persistence or execution intent across multiple surfaces, then route the analyst into the correct ecosystem composite.

### Two Rule Types

**Type 1 — Ecosystem Truth Rules** answer: *"Is this specific attack mechanism real?"*  
Anchor to a single ecosystem. Prove a minimum truth artefact. High-fidelity, ecosystem-pure.

**Type 2 — Router / Surface Rules** answer: *"Is persistence being attempted anywhere, and where do we pivot?"*  
Sit above ecosystems. Detect broad intent. Directional sensors — not final truth.

```
Router Rule fires:
  schtasks.exe /create ... powershell -enc ...
  → Surface: Scheduled Task persistence intent
  → Severity: HIGH
  → Directive: Pivot into ScheduledTask_Abuse composite

Ecosystem Composite confirms:
  → /tr payload path validated
  → Script engine abuse confirmed
  → Writable staging path present
  → Prevalence + reinforcement scored
  → Persistence truth confirmed
```

> **Router rules detect intent.**  
> **Ecosystem rules confirm truth.**  
> **This prevents monoliths while maintaining full surface coverage.**

## Production Deployment

Each Composite Rule is deployed as an always-on detection sensor:

- **Truth Anchor** defines the technique
- **Reinforcement** increases confidence — never dependency
- **Cousin Rules** provide adjacent surface parity
- **Attack Ecosystem chaining** creates incidents without monolithic kill-chain queries

### Two-Layer Correlation Model

Operational correlation happens **outside** individual rules:

**Cousin Confirmation:** Multiple cousins firing = capability confirmed at higher confidence. Example: TaskCache persistence + schtasks classifier both fire → persistence ecosystem confirmed across surfaces.

**Attack Story Chaining:** Multiple attack-stage truths converging = intrusion incident. Example: Ingress → Execution → Persistence → Lateral Movement truths all fire on same entity → incident created with full narrative.

## The Attack Ecosystem ATLAS

While this repository provides the **tactical sensors**, understanding how these sensors fit together requires a strategic map.

### Why You Need The ATLAS

The Framework provides the **Micro-View** (Rule Logic):
- How do I detect Scheduled Task abuse?
- What is the Minimum Truth for a Run Key?
- Why does `scrcons.exe` loading `vbscript.dll` matter?

The ATLAS provides the **Macro-View** (Ecosystem Strategy):
- How does the Scheduled Task rule relate to its Cousin in Registry Persistence?
- Which rules form the complete Lateral Movement ecosystem?
- How do I deploy these composites to cover an entire attack surface without gaps?

**[Enter The ATLAS — The Strategic Map of Attack Ecosystems](https://github.com/azdabat/ATLAS-ATTACK-ECOSSYSTEM)**
